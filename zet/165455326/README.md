# how to make a zettel entry
This is the body of the zettel (also called slips)

* bullet 1
* bullet 2

But when I have an ordered or numbered lsit:
1. First
2. Second 

```python
for i in range(0,25):
  print(i)

```




*italic* **bold** ***bolditalic***

how about looking like `code`?

and when I have a URL i want it to print also so I walways write it out liek this:
https://rwx.gg

* put references at the bottom
